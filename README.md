# Life Line â€“ Frontend

_A simple way to reflect on your days and see the bigger picture of your life._

**Life Line** is a personal journaling and well-being tracker. Each day, users can log a short description of what happened and give the day a **score from 1 to 10**. These daily entries are saved and displayed as part of the userâ€™s **lifeline** â€” a timeline that visually represents their journey over time.

The frontend, built with **React and TypeScript**, provides the interactive interface that makes it possible for users to:

- **Create daily entries** â€“ Write a short description and rate the day from 1 (bad) to 10 (excellent).
- **Explore the lifeline** â€“ View all past days as dots along a horizontal timeline.
- **Color-coded insights** â€“ Each day is represented with an automatic color based on its score:
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green for good days
  - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow for average days
  - ðŸ”´ Red for bad days
- **Track progress at a glance** â€“ See average scores calculated for:
  - The last 7 days
  - The last 30 days
  - Year-to-date

The project is designed to help users **reflect on their lives, identify patterns, and celebrate progress**. By turning daily reflections into a simple visual journey, _Life Line_ makes personal growth and self-awareness both accessible and meaningful.

This repository contains the **frontend component** of the application, which delivers the user experience and connects seamlessly with the backend.
